# Personal-Information-Form
A GUI that collects individuals’ personal information and saves it into a database.

Using Python, I created a GUI that collects individuals' information, including name, last name, national ID, age, gender, education, expertise, phone number, and address, and stores it in a database. The form includes two buttons: Submit and Clear. The Clear button allows users to erase any incorrect entries, while the Submit button saves the information to the database if everything is correct.
You need to install the Tkinter and SQLite3 libraries. You also need to install DB Browser if you want to access the database file.
This project is very helpful for those who want to understand GUI features and explore the world of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).
